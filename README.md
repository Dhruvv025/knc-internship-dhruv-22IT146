This repository documents my Summer Internship 2025 at **KnC Future Tech**, focused on cloud computing, serverless development, and applied AI on AWS.

Over four weeks (May 15, 2025 – June 15, 2025), I built:
- A **RAG Chatbot** using Amazon Bedrock (Llama 3), Titan Embeddings, OpenSearch Serverless, and S3.
- **BhashaBridge**, a serverless **document translation** pipeline using S3, Lambda, Transfer Family, IAM, and CloudWatch.
- I also explored **multi‑cloud** (Azure, GCP, Oracle) and earned the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification.

##📌 Internship Summary :

I completed my Summer Internship 2025 at KnC Future Tech, where I worked on cloud computing, serverless development, and AI-powered solutions using AWS. The internship spanned four weeks (May 15 – June 15, 2025) and focused on applying theoretical knowledge to real-world projects.

Week 1: Explored core AWS services — S3, EC2, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch, and Transfer Family.

Week 2: Designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Amazon Bedrock (Llama 3), Titan Embeddings, OpenSearch Serverless, and S3.

Week 3: Built and deployed BhashaBridge, a serverless document translation pipeline using S3, Lambda, Transfer Family, IAM, and CloudWatch.

Week 4: Expanded my knowledge by exploring multi-cloud platforms (Azure, GCP, Oracle) and successfully earned the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

This internship helped me strengthen my hands-on expertise in cloud computing, enhanced my problem-solving skills, and gave me exposure to multi-cloud environments and industry-standard certifications.
