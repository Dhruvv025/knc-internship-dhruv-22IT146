This repository documents my Summer Internship 2025 at **KnC Future Tech**, focused on cloud computing, serverless development, and applied AI on AWS.

Over four weeks (May 15, 2025 – June 15, 2025), I built:
- A **RAG Chatbot** using Amazon Bedrock (Llama 3), Titan Embeddings, OpenSearch Serverless, and S3.
- **BhashaBridge**, a serverless **document translation** pipeline using S3, Lambda, Transfer Family, IAM, and CloudWatch.
- I also explored **multi‑cloud** (Azure, GCP, Oracle) and earned the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification.
